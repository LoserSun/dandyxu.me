# Day 1: Arrive in London

## St. Paul's Cathedral

Actually I went to St. Paul's Cathedral back to 2015, my first time to visit London. However, I didn't go into the builiding because of the lacking of the time. I still remember at that time, we finished exploring the Tate Modern Museum, going across the millennium bridge, then had a nice, Itanlian (or French) style food. I think it's Burger as I didn't know so many English or French words, so can't even order the food.

This time, we booked the tickets and went inside of St. Paul's Cathedral. It was the tallest building in the London for many years until The Shard and Sky Gardern built up.

Unfortunately, it wasn't allowed to take photos inside of the main building so there are no photos to show. Here is a photo which I took from outside:

In the cathedral, actually you can climb up to the top. There are three Galleries you can reach. First one is called - "Whispering Gallery", you need to climb from the ground floor, all the way up, about 257 steps. It was actually built for workers to maintence and fix the dome but it's open for visitors now. I climbed up and looked down upon - Unreal view from top to the whole ground floor. What a pity I couldn't take a photo!

After "Whispering Gallery", about 376 steps up, there is a level called - "Stone Gallery". From here, actually you can go outside to view the scenes of the central London. Some photos I took from there:

Another 152 steps up, you will reach the top of the cathedral - "Goldern Gallery". It's quick small but the view from there were even better because of the height.

#### Personal Rate: 5 Star, highly recommended.
